# ModernVet - Flutter

This is a Flutter application for a take home test of ModernVet.

## Notes

Since the API is local only, I use telebit services to let the app connect via a https url. Change the baseUrl in the ApiService to your local ip address to run the app locally or use the telebit url to run the app on the cloud.

## Getting Started

To run the application, you need to have Flutter installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `flutter pub get` to install the dependencies
3. Run `flutter run` to run the application
